                                <i style="font-size: x-small;">Commencing your technical interview preparation at the earliest possible juncture offers distinct advantages. Nevertheless, it is paramount to underscore the prerequisite of acquiring proficiency in a programming language before embarking on this endeavor. To facilitate this, it is recommended to prioritize the completion of your initial programming language course. Furthermore, at the completion it is advisable to initiate the second step concurrently with the first, thus enabling you to commence the arduous and demanding process of dedicated technical interview practice even before you have concluded the first step. This approach ultimately serves to expedite your journey toward achieving mastery in this specialized domain.</i>

                                <i style="font-size: x-small;">Upon successful completion of your initial technical course, it is advisable to update your résumé and include a comprehensive selection of projects accomplished during the course. Furthermore, since you have completed your first technical course, it is prudent to embark on personal project development and subsequently incorporate them into your résumé. For inspiration, one can explore YouTube for projects created by others in the field of their programming languages and technical skills, aiming to undertake similar initiatives. Ensuring the inclusion of these projects in your résumé is of paramount importance. It is advisable to keep your résumé concise, usually limited to one page, you should strive to include as many pertinent projects as possible within this page, as they are deemed valuable experiential assets. <b>Ensuring the availability of your projects on <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a> is imperative.</b></i>

                                <i style="font-size: x-small;">Internships hold a distinct advantage over projects when it comes to enhancing your résumé, and in some cases, you can secure an internship even before completing your first technical course. The sooner you obtain an internship and include it on your résumé, the more it will bolster your chances of securing future employment. I strongly recommend prioritizing paid internships as the preferred choice over unpaid ones.</i>

This is contingent on the selection of either the optional "CS 131B - Programming Fundamentals: Python" or the "CS 132A - Ruby Programming" course. Opting for "CNIT 133 - JavaScript, jQuery, AJAX" in lieu of Python or Ruby does not align with the back-end web focus, as JavaScript is predominantly a front-end language. While the program does include instruction in shell scripting and DevOps, essential components of back-end web development, proficiency in a back-end specific language, such as Python or Ruby, is crucial. Mastery of these languages, in combination with DevOps skills, is integral to being fully versed as a back-end developer.

                                <i class="p-4" style="font-size: x-small;">Many individuals secure employment without excelling in technical interviews. It's entirely possible to secure a job even if you struggle with technical interviews, although this may limit your access to various opportunities. It's important to note that most technical interviews are typically of moderate difficulty, with some being easier. In certain cases, you may not even encounter a technical interview.</i>
                                <br>
                                <i class="p-4" style="font-size: x-small;">However, your prospects of securing a job significantly improve if you can successfully navigate technical interviews at the "Hard" difficulty level. If you find that completing options A, B, C, or D still doesn't enable you to excel in coding challenges at the highest difficulty level. You may want to contemplate completing one additional or all of options A, B, C, & D. If challenges persist despite these efforts, you may want to explore option "E."</i>
                                <br>
                                <i class="p-4" style="font-size: x-small;">Option "E" encompasses a multitude of technical coding challenges.  Notably, option "E" has a cost-free vertion, making it accessible even if financial constraints limit your ability to pursue other options. Although "E" is a more challenging path to proficiency, with persistence and practice, you should eventually develop the skills needed to excel in coding challenges at the highest difficulty level.</i>

Building a robust professional network involves maintaining ongoing connections with individuals in your industry through channels like email, text messages, or LinkedIn messaging. You can expand this network by staying in touch with former classmates, colleagues from previous jobs, or individuals you've encountered in the tech sector. It is crucial to uphold positive relationships and sustain ongoing communication. Your network can serve as valuable references when pursuing potential job opportunities. Furthermore, in the event of job loss, having a well-maintained network can facilitate a quicker return to a high-paying position by reaching out to network contacts and requesting referrals to positions within their respective companies. Often, these companies incentivize referrals with bonuses, making your request well-received and beneficial for both parties involved.</i>
