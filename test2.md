To solve this coding challenge, we can implement a Trie data structure that supports operations to insert a word, search for an exact word, and check if any word starts with a given prefix.

We'll create a `Trie` class with the following methods:

1. `__init__`: Initializes an empty dictionary to represent the root of the trie.
2. `insert`: Inserts a word into the trie.
3. `search`: Searches for an exact word in the trie.
4. `startsWith`: Checks if any word in the trie starts with a given prefix.

Each node in the trie can be represented by a dictionary, where keys are characters and values are the next level dictionaries (nodes). To mark the end of a word, we can use a special symbol, such as `'$', and set its value to `True`.

# Explanation

1. **Initialization (`__init__` method)**:
   - Initialize an empty dictionary `root` to represent the root of the trie.

2. **Insertion (`insert` method)**:
   - For each character in the word, navigate through the trie using the character as the key.
   - If the character is not present, create a new dictionary for it.
   - Finally, mark the end of the word by adding a special key `'$': True`.

3. **Search (`search` method)**:
   - For each character in the word, navigate through the trie.
   - If any character is not present, return `False`.
   - After navigating all characters, check if the current node contains the special key `'$'` to determine if it is a word.

4. **Prefix Check (`startsWith` method)**:
   - For each character in the prefix, navigate through the trie.
   - If any character is not present, return `False`.
   - If all characters are found, return `True`.

# Pseudocode

```pseudocode
class Trie:
    function __init__:
        root = {}

    function insert(word):
        node = root
        for char in word:
            if char not in node:
                node[char] = {}
            node = node[char]
        node['$'] = True

    function search(word) -> boolean:
        node = root
        for char in word:
            if char not in node:
                return False
            node = node[char]
        return '$' in node

    function startsWith(prefix) -> boolean:
        node = root
        for char in prefix:
            if char not in node:
                return False
            node = node[char]
        return True
```

This pseudocode outlines the methods in a `Trie` class for inserting words, searching for exact matches, and checking if any word starts with a given prefix.
