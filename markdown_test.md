To solve this coding challenge, we will implement a Trie (Prefix Tree) data structure. This data structure will allow us to store and retrieve strings efficiently, and answer prefix-related queries effectively. The Trie class will have methods to insert a string, search for an exact string, and check if any previously inserted strings start with a given prefix.

## Explanation
1. **Initialization:** We initialize the Trie with an empty root dictionary.
2. **Insertion:** We insert a string into the Trie. For each character in the string, if the character does not exist in the current node, we create a new node for that character. After inserting all characters, we mark the end of the word by adding a special symbol.
3. **Search:** We search for an exact string in the Trie. We iterate through each character of the string. If at any point, a character is not found, the search fails. If all characters are found, we check for the end marker to confirm the word's presence.
4. **StartsWith:** We check if any previously inserted word starts with the given prefix by iterating through each character of the prefix. If all characters of the prefix are found in the Trie, it confirms the presence of such a prefix.

## Pseudocode
```
Class Trie:
    Method __init__():
        Initialize the root as an empty dictionary

    Method insert(word: String):
        Initialize node as root
        For each character char in word:
            If char is not in node:
                Set node[char] = empty dictionary
            Move to the node[char]
        Mark the end of the word by setting node['$'] = True

    Method search(word: String) -> Boolean:
        Initialize node as root
        For each character char in word:
            If char is not in node:
                Return False
            Move to the node[char]
        Return True if '$' is in node, else return False

    Method startsWith(prefix: String) -> Boolean:
        Initialize node as root
        For each character char in prefix:
            If char is not in node:
                Return False
            Move to the node[char]
        Return True
```

The above explanation and pseudocode outline the steps to implement the `Trie` class, providing a clear and detailed approach to solve this coding challenge.
