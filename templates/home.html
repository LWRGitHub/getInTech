Nevertheless, it is paramount to underscore the prerequisite of acquiring proficiency in a programming language before embarking on this endeavor. To facilitate this, it is recommended to prioritize the completion of your initial programming language course. Furthermore, at the completion it is advisable to initiate the second step concurrently with the first, thus enabling you to commence the arduous and demanding process of dedicated technical interview practice even before you have concluded the first step. This approach ultimately serves to expedite your journey toward achieving mastery in this specialized domain.</i>

This is contingent on the selection of either the optional "CS 131B - Programming Fundamentals: Python" or the "CS 132A - Ruby Programming" course. Opting for "CNIT 133 - JavaScript, jQuery, AJAX" in lieu of Python or Ruby does not align with the back-end web focus, as JavaScript is predominantly a front-end language. While the program does include instruction in shell scripting and DevOps, essential components of back-end web development, proficiency in a back-end specific language, such as Python or Ruby, is crucial. Mastery of these languages, in combination with DevOps skills, is integral to being fully versed as a back-end developer.
