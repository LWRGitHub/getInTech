    "To solve this coding challenge, we need to create a class `ArrayWrapper` that will encapsulate an array of integers, providing specific functionality: ",
    "1. Adding two instances of this class using the `+` operator should result in the sum of all elements in both arrays.",
    "2. Converting an instance to a string using the `String()` function should return a comma-separated string representation of the array surrounded by brackets.",
    "Let's break down the solution into clear steps:",
    "# Explanation",
    "1. **Constructor**: The class will have a constructor that accepts an array of integers and assigns it to an instance variable.",
    "2. **Addition (`+` operator)**: To make two instances of the class addable using the `+` operator, we\u2019ll need to define a method that the interpreter will call during such operations. In JavaScript, this is done using the `valueOf` method.",
    "3. **String representation**: To control the string conversion of an instance, we can define the `toString` method, which will be called when `String()` or template literals are used.",
    "# Pseudocode",
    "Here's the pseudocode that summarizes the solution:",
    "```",
    "class ArrayWrapper:",
    "    # Constructor to initialize the array",
    "    def __init__(self, nums):",
    "        this.nums = nums",
    "",
    "    # Method to handle the addition of two instances",
    "    def __add__(self, other):",
    "        if isinstance(other, ArrayWrapper):",
    "            return sum(self.nums) + sum(other.nums)",
    "        return NotImplemented",
    "",
    "    # Method to convert the instance to a string",
    "    def __str__(self):",
    "        return '[' + ','.join(map(str, self.nums)) + ']'",
    "```",
    "1. **Constructor**: Initialize the array attribute with the given input array.",
    "2. **Addition (`__add__` method)**: Check if the other object is an instance of `ArrayWrapper`. If so, return the sum of elements in both arrays.",
    "3. **String conversion (`__str__` method)**: Convert the list of numbers to a comma-separated string and surround it with brackets.",
    "This pseudocode outlines how the required functionality can be implemented. Adjustments may be needed to fit the syntax and idioms of the actual programming language used, but the overall logic will remain the same."
