This is contingent on the selection of either the optional "CS 131B - Programming Fundamentals: Python" or the "CS 132A - Ruby Programming" course. Opting for "CNIT 133 - JavaScript, jQuery, AJAX" in lieu of Python or Ruby does not align with the back-end web focus, as JavaScript is predominantly a front-end language. While the program does include instruction in shell scripting and DevOps, essential components of back-end web development, proficiency in a back-end specific language, such as Python or Ruby, is crucial. Mastery of these languages, in combination with DevOps skills, is integral to being fully versed as a back-end developer.
