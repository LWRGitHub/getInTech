    "To solve this coding challenge, we need to understand the inherent pattern that develops from the toggling rounds. Let's break down the solution:",
    "# Explanation",
    "1. Each bulb will be toggled in its corresponding rounds. For example, the first bulb gets toggled in every round, the second bulb gets toggled in every second round, and so on.",
    "2. A bulb ends up being on if it is toggled an odd number of times. Bulb `i` is toggled every time `j` (where `j` is a factor of `i`).",
    "3. A bulb will have an odd number of toggles if `i` has an odd number of factors, or more simply, if `i` is a perfect square. This is due to the fact that factors usually come in pairs, except for perfect squares which have a middle number that appears only once.",
    "4. Therefore, the problem boils down to counting the number of perfect squares up to `n`.",
    "# Pseudocode",
    "```",
    "def bulbSwitch(n):",
    "    # Explanation: ",
    "    # Number of bulbs that remain ON are the perfect squares up to n.",
    "    # This is because perfect square numbers have an odd number of divisors.",
    "    ",
    "    # Calculate the number of perfect squares up to n",
    "    result = int(n ** 0.5)",
    "    ",
    "    # Return the result",
    "    return result",
    "```",
    "This method leverages the fact that the perfect squares are the bulbs that stay on because they are toggled an odd number of times. The count of such perfect squares up to any number `n` is computed directly by taking the integer part of the square root of `n`. This makes the solution both simple and efficient."
