To solve this coding challenge, we first need to understand the structure and functioning of a Trie (Prefix Tree). A Trie is a tree-like data structure that stores strings in a way that allows for efficient retrieval of words, especially when dealing with operations like prefix searches.

# Explanation

1. **Trie Initialization (`__init__` method)**:
   - We initialize our Trie with an empty dictionary `root` which will act as the root node of the Trie.

2. **Insert a Word into the Trie (`insert` method)**:
   - We start at the root of the Trie.
   - For each character in the word, if the character is not already present as a child of the current node, we create a new dictionary for that character.
   - We then move to the next level (child node) and repeat until all characters are inserted.
   - After inserting all characters of the word, we mark the end of the word by adding a special symbol `$` with a value of `True`.

3. **Search for a Word in the Trie (`search` method)**:
   - We start at the root and traverse through each character of the word.
   - For each character, if the character is not found in the current node, the word does not exist in the Trie and we return `False`.
   - If we successfully traverse through all characters, we then check for the special end-of-word symbol `$` to confirm the presence of the complete word.

4. **Check for a Prefix in the Trie (`startsWith` method)**:
   - Similar to the search method, we start at the root and traverse through each character of the prefix.
   - If any character in the prefix is not found in the current node, the prefix does not exist in the Trie and we return `False`.
   - If we successfully traverse through all characters, we return `True` since the prefix exists in the Trie.

## Pseudocode

```pseudo
class Trie:
    # Initialize the Trie with an empty dictionary as root
    method __init__():
        root = {}

    # Insert a word into the Trie
    method insert(word):
        node = root
        for each char in word:
            if char not in node:
                node[char] = {}
            node = node[char]
        node['$'] = True  # Mark the end of the word

    # Search for a word in the Trie
    method search(word) -> boolean:
        node = root
        for each char in word:
            if char not in node:
                return False
            node = node[char]
        return '$' in node  # Return True if the end of word marker is found

    # Check if there is any word in the Trie that starts with the given prefix
    method startsWith(prefix) -> boolean:
        node = root
        for each char in prefix:
            if char not in node:
                return False
            node = node[char]
        return True  # All characters in prefix are found, so return True
```

This pseudocode covers the initialization, insertion of words, searching for words, and checking for prefixes in a Trie data structure. This is the methodology for solving the coding challenge.
