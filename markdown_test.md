"To solve this coding challenge, we first need to understand the structure and functioning of a Trie (Prefix Tree). A Trie is a tree-like data structure that stores strings in a way that allows for efficient retrieval of words, especially when dealing with operations like prefix searches.\n\n# Explanation\n\n1. **Trie Initialization (`__init__` method)**:\n   - We initialize our Trie with an empty dictionary `root` which will act as the root node of the Trie.\n\n2. **Insert a Word into the Trie (`insert` method)**:\n   - We start at the root of the Trie.\n   - For each character in the word, if the character is not already present as a child of the current node, we create a new dictionary for that character.\n   - We then move to the next level (child node) and repeat until all characters are inserted.\n   - After inserting all characters of the word, we mark the end of the word by adding a special symbol `$` with a value of `True`.\n\n3. **Search for a Word in the Trie (`search` method)**:\n   - We start at the root and traverse through each character of the word.\n   - For each character, if the character is not found in the current node, the word does not exist in the Trie and we return `False`.\n   - If we successfully traverse through all characters, we then check for the special end-of-word symbol `$` to confirm the presence of the complete word.\n\n4. **Check for a Prefix in the Trie (`startsWith` method)**:\n   - Similar to the search method, we start at the root and traverse through each character of the prefix.\n   - If any character in the prefix is not found in the current node, the prefix does not exist in the Trie and we return `False`.\n   - If we successfully traverse through all characters, we return `True` since the prefix exists in the Trie.\n\n# Pseudocode\n\n```pseudo\nclass Trie:\n    # Initialize the Trie with an empty dictionary as root\n    method __init__():\n        root = {}\n\n    # Insert a word into the Trie\n    method insert(word):\n        node = root\n        for each char in word:\n            if char not in node:\n                node[char] = {}\n            node = node[char]\n        node['$'] = True  # Mark the end of the word\n\n    # Search for a word in the Trie\n    method search(word) -> boolean:\n        node = root\n        for each char in word:\n            if char not in node:\n                return False\n            node = node[char]\n        return '$' in node  # Return True if the end of word marker is found\n\n    # Check if there is any word in the Trie that starts with the given prefix\n    method startsWith(prefix) -> boolean:\n        node = root\n        for each char in prefix:\n            if char not in node:\n                return False\n            node = node[char]\n        return True  # All characters in prefix are found, so return True\n```\n\nThis pseudocode covers the initialization, insertion of words, searching for words, and checking for prefixes in a Trie data structure. This is the methodology for solving the coding challenge."
