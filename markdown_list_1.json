    "To solve this coding challenge, we want to find two indices in the array `nums` such that their corresponding elements add up to the given `target`. We will use a hash table (dictionary) to achieve this in an optimal way, aiming for a time complexity of O(n).",
    "",
    "# Explanation",
    "",
    "1. **Understanding the Problem**: We are given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`. The task is to find two indices in `nums` such that the sum of the elements at these indices equals `target`. We must assume the input has exactly one solution, and an element cannot be used twice.",
    "",
    "2. **Naive Approach**: The naive approach involves using two nested loops to check all pairs of elements and finding the ones that sum up to `target`. This leads to a time complexity of O(n^2).",
    "",
    "3. **Optimal Approach**: A more efficient method uses a hash table (dictionary). By iterating through the array once while keeping track of the elements we've seen and their indices in the hash table, we can reduce the time complexity to O(n). This approach works by:",
    "   - Checking if the complement of the current element (i.e., `target - current element`) has already been seen.",
    "   - If it has been seen, the current element and the seen element sum to `target`, and their indices are returned.",
    "   - If it hasn\u2019t been seen, the current element and its index are added to the hash table.",
    "",
    "4. **Hash Table Utilization**: A hash table allows O(1) average-time complexity for both insert and lookup operations. This is why our optimal approach is efficient.",

    "1. Initialize an empty hash table to store elements and their indices.",
    "2. Loop through each element in the array:",
    "   - Calculate the complement by subtracting the current element from the target.",
    "   - Check if the complement is already in the hash table.",
    "   - If it is, return the current index and the index of the complement from the hash table.",
    "   - If it isn\u2019t, add the current element and its index to the hash table.",
    "3. The function should return the indices found if they satisfy the requirements.",
